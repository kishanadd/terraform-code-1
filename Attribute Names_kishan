Attribute Names
Below is an example of a resource configuration block which illustrates some general design patterns that can apply across all plugin object types:

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami                    = "ami-408c7f28"
  instance_type          = "t1.micro"
  monitoring             = true
  vpc_security_group_ids = [
      "sg-1436abcf",
  ]
  tags          = {
    Name        = "Application Server"
    Environment = "production"
  }
   root_block_device {
    delete_on_termination = false
  }
}
